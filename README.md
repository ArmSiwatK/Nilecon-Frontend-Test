## Notes

- The seat selection component currently only accommodates two-seat selection â€“ that is, it currently always assumes a selection is two seats, as I realized too late that there are, in fact, single seats available for reservation. I believe, however, that accommodating other halls is beyond the requirements of this mockup.
